# Socket
**Course Code:** NWEN241 - Systems Programming
**Your Name:** Margaret Nieves Gonzales

**Description:**
- Made a server using C to read and write input from client. A restraint is that it can only handle one client.

**How to Improve for next time?:**

I would make it a concurrent server by using the fork() and the wait() commands.
